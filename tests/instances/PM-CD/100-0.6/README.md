> I run these patch which has 100 agents, it's too slow (more than 5 hours), my machine run time out. I'm confused if somewhere i config wrong.

these two template files `cdcop_random_bird.yaml` and `cdcop_random_bird_vardist.yaml` is generated by:

```bash
pydcop --output cdcop_random_bird.yaml generate cdcop_random_bird --agent_count "100" --graph_density "0.6"
```
